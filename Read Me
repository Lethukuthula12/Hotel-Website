 Hey Fred!!
i'm looking forward on working with you!!

so as i mentioned earlier on, i'm working on this unknown and un-existing hotel website.

i broke my components into sections. from section 1-6. Sorry for my naming of classes and ids.
i was just working alone so i named them anything i wanted, as long as the code was working

i was working on section 6, so far. my code did work but when i opened it today, is no longer working which i still trying to debug it as we speak.

Implementation:
1. We need to implement that full screen dropdown form the navigation bar. check our clone website!!
2. I wanted to implement the on-Scroll animation from our site. check our clone as you scroll down on what it does.
3. Implement that Scroll buttons, the ones that ain't working anymore on section 6.
